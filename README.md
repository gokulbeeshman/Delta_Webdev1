Delta Web Dev Task 1

Uses execCommand() function on a contenteditable="true" textbox to create a rich text editor.
Only dold and ditalics apply to whole document.
All others work like a regular text editor.

Uses icons from mozilla's developer guides for bold,italics etc.

JSfiddle demo (without icons as jsfiddle doesn't allow image resources, labels are provided on hover)
